Oh, well hello, I didn't see you there!

I'm Nathcat, I've been programming since I was eleven, when my maths teacher made the entire class start learning Python on Codecademy.
While the rest of the class stopped doing this after a few terms, I was hooked after the first lesson and continued learning in my own time.

At fourteen, I started branching out into other, more complex languages. Under the instruction of my computer science teacher at the time, I started learning Java.
Over the multitude of Covid lockdowns, I have vastly improved my programming, probably because I had nothing else to do, so most of my free time, especially in
between live lessons, was spent programming. More recently, I have started learning C, I'm getting better at C# for Unity development, and I have had some experience
with HTML, CSS, Js, and PHP, although they are not exactly my strong points.

My two main languages are Python and Java.

I can also solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube in less than 20 seconds :)

Hey, I'm Nathcat!

I've been programming since 2016 when my Maths teacher made us learn Python on Codecademy, while the rest of the class lost interest, I fell in love with it.

Since then I have been branching out into other languages and frameworks, I have a lot of experience in my own projects, my most recent one is MessageCat, a messaging application built for Android.
